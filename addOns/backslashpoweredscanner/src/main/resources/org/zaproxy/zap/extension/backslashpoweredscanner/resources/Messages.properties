backslashpoweredscanner.backendparameterenumeration.name = Backend Parameter Enumeration
backslashpoweredscanner.backendparameterenumeration.desc = It may be possible to enumerate backend parameters, based on differing HTTP responses when valid and invalid parameters are provided. This would greatly increase the probability of success of HPP (HTTP Parameter Pollution) attacks against the system. Please manually check the 'Other Info' field to confirm if this is actually an issue. 
backslashpoweredscanner.backendparameterenumeration.soln = Do not divulge details of whether a parameter is valid or invalid. In particular, do not differentiate between an invalid user and an invalid password in the error message, page title, page contents, HTTP headers, or redirection logic.
